# The camera firmware is proprietary Apple code and cannot be redistributed, so

# Apple-hosted OS X 10.11.5 update that contains the AppleCameraInterface kext,
# carves the firmware out of it, verifies both against known SHA-256 values, and
# installs it. This is the only step in the project that touches the network.
#
# Changes from upstream: staging happens in a private mktemp directory instead
# of fixed /tmp paths, curl verifies TLS certificates, the unused --dmg path
# (which needed 7z/xar/pbzx and referenced a hardcoded 10.11.3 package name) and
# the Debian packaging targets are gone.

Usage: sudo $0 [OPTIONS]

Downloads the AppleCameraInterface kext from Apple's servers, extracts the
FaceTime HD camera firmware from it, and installs it as firmware.bin.

  -x, --driver FILE   Extract from a local driver instead of downloading.
                      Either an AppleCameraInterface kext binary or the
                      AppleCamera.sys from a Boot Camp package.
      --dest DIR      Install into DIR (default: $(firmware_root)/$MODULE_NAME).
      --no-install    Leave the files in the current directory; do not install
                      them. Does not require root.
  -i, --ignore-hashes Accept a firmware whose SHA-256 is not in the known-good
                      table, provided its header and footer look right.
      --with-calibration
                      Also fetch the sensor calibration (.dat) files. These fix
                      the camera's colours and live only in the Windows Boot
                      Camp driver, so this is a second ~1.2 MB download and
                      needs unar (or unrar) to unpack it.
      --calibration-only
                      Fetch only the calibration files; leave firmware.bin
                      alone. Use when the firmware is already installed.
      --sys FILE      Take the calibration files from a local AppleCamera.sys
                      instead of downloading Boot Camp.
      --check-sources Verify that both Apple downloads still resolve and still
                      contain what the checksum tables above expect, then exit.
                      Installs nothing, writes nothing and needs no root.
                      Non-zero exit means an install would fail today.
  -h, --help          Show this help.
